This document describes the naming convention for the various kinds 
of DSOs (Dynamic Shared Objects).

NOTE: Files of the format xxxx.la are libtool files that describe the
actual DSO. The DSO itself is usually named xxxx.so or libxxxx.so.
Some platforms require that the name of a DSO starts with "lib". On
those platforms xxxx.la and libxxxx.la both generate DSOs with the
same name "libxxxx.so". Since this leads to problems you should never
use both "xxxx.la" and "libxxxx.la" as names for DSOs!!

*** Since <appname>.la is reserved for KDEInit loadable modules, it is 
*** strongly recommended NEVER to use lib<appname>.la as the name of a 
*** library.

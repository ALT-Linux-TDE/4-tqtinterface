qaccessible




All headers that contain the keywork TQ_OBJECT have been ported,
exept for these due to *@#$ private functions

qclipboard
qcolordialog
qdragobject (QDragManager)
qfontdialog
qguardedptr (TQGuardedPtr, weird compilation failure)
qinputdialog
qnetworkprotocol (QNetworkProtocolFactory, weird compilation failure)
qsessionmanager
qtranslator (TQT_NO_TRANSLATION is set, MOC does not honor #ifdef)
qwidgetplugin (TQWidgetContainerPlugin, weird compilation failure)



And these that do not contain TQ_OBJECT are failing:

qasciicache
qasciidict
qcache
qcleanuphandler
qdeepcopy
qdict
qintcache
qintdict
qmap
qmemarray
qptrdict
qptrlist
qptrqueue
qsortedlist
qsqlpropertymap
qsqlselectcursor
qthreadstorage
qtl
qvaluelist
qvaluestack

This may have something to do with the template class junk

Weird headers with no classes (???):

tqdrawutil




Here's the latest proposed structure of the library...

All of Trinity now uses TQ<something>, e.g. QTimer is now TQTimer.  Depending on the QT3 or QT4 flag, certain defines are set in tqt.h like the following:
#define TQCString QCString (for Qt3)
#define TQCString Q3CString (for Qt4)

If needed, the TQ function can subclass the Q or Q3 function and reimplement the missing features.  However, the vast majority of classes (those that have not changed much) will be handled with the simple #define statements, greatly simplifying and speeding implementation.
